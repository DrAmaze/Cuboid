  # This method will rotate the cuboid. If the cuboid's rotation
  # is impeded, the rotation will not happenand the function will return
  # false. If the rotation occurs, the new vertices will be returned.
  # The rotation will be at 90 degree intervals.
  # Walls will be input as an array of other Cuboid objects.

  # The manner that this method checks for impediments is a good
  # approximation, but is not entirely accurate. This method simply
  # expands the cuboid about the axis it is being rotated by its scalar
  # distance from origin to appropriate vertex. It then checks to see if
  # there are now any intersections at this larger size.  If not, then
  # the box will be able to rotate smoothly.

  # of the box into spherical coordinates and call #intersection? at
  # each deg of rotation.
